<h3>
    Demos - Case Study :: Pong - Intro
</h3>
<hr />
<p>
    In order to show how one might approach a non-trivial project with TactJS, I decided
    to recreate Pong. This case study is split into several iterations which can be
    downloaded individually and serve to track the progress toward an optimal solution.
</p>
<p>
    I'm aware that there are HTML5 techniques for accomplishing the objectives of this
    case study, and if you were really tasked with creating a game for the browser without
    a plugin like Flash I would suggest you look into them. The real purpose of this
    case study however, is to explore the possibilities of TactJS, and something like
    Pong lets us have some fun along the way.
</p>
<p>
    The stated objectives of Case Study :: Pong are thus:
    <ol>
        <li>Two players, one of which is an AI opponent.</li>
        <li>Track score per round.</li>
        <li>Difficulty levels, with increasing difficulty from round to round.</li>
        <li>2d ball physics (optional)</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    The solution must also meet the following criteria:
    <ol>
        <li>Object oriented project library.</li>
        <li>Front-end uses TactJS behaviors.</li>
        <li>Event and message driven contracts.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    This case study is a work in progress. Please continue to check for updates to the
    iteration list. If you would like to try your hand at a solution using TactJS,
    by all means let me know what you come up with by sending your solution to <a class="txt-white" href="mailto:pong-solutions@tactjs.com"
