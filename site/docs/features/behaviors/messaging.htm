<h3>
    Features - Behaviors - Message and Broadcast</h3>
<hr />
<p>
    The messaging architecture of TactJS behaviors allows you to make method calls
    with parameters in a completely decoupled fashion. Sending messages or broadcasts
    that affect elements with uninitialized behaviors (declared with the "lazy" modifier)
    will cause those behaviors to be loaded through the bootloader before the action
    in the message or broadcast is executed. Message and broadcast are the prefered
    method for triggering or waking up behaviors that don't need to be initialized when
    the page is rendered.

<ul>
    <li><strong>message</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>When you send a message to an element, any behaviors declared on that element will
                "respond" by executing the named method if they have it.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>broadcast</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>A broadcast will send a message to all the children of the element that was broadcast
                to, and is a quick way to send a message to multiple elements witht he same or different
                behaviors. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
