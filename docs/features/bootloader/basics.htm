<p>
    The TactJS bootloader retrieves scripts and files two ways.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Require By Type
        <div class="ind10">
            This is the method used when behaviors are loaded asyncronously. It converts a namespace
            to a URL relative to _scriptsRoot and tries to load a .js file.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>Require
        <div class="ind10">
            This method accepts a URL to a script file and tries to load it.
        </div>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Both of these methods accept an "onLoaded" function which is called when the resource
    is available. When behaviors are loaded through the bootloader, the onLoaded function
    is the "init" method in the public space of a new instance of the behavior loaded,
    and the context of that behavior is passed to init.
</p>
<p>
    The bootloader is a coroutine for behaviors and we don't recomment using it directly
    unless you absolutely have to. <a class="txt-white" href="demos.htm#/demos-behaviors-advanced">The advanced behaviors Animals demo</a> shows you how
    you might use it if you need to though.
</p>
<p>
    The bootloader is evolving! Future versions of TactJS will allow resources to
    be declared as dependencies so that loading one script file or behavior sets off
    a chain reaction, loading all the required scripts from one trigger.
